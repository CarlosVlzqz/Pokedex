## Explain how you would improve the application and future plans.

I would create a Team feature were you would be able to create a pokemon team and it would provide some insight about your team; its weaknesses, strenghts, the most common pokemon type in your team and even some suggestions to strengthen your team, to perform this tasks I would use Redux similarly to the way I used it in this project.

## If you weren't able to finish all the goals of the project, how would you go out exucuting them?

I consider I complied with the tasks of the test.

## Explain your thoughts on the project you built, the Architecture of the folders, how you built the pages, and elements, etc.

I created my project separating the components which compose it from the actions they perform, additionally I used SASS to style my components, creating a separated folder for this porpuse.
This Architecture allows the project to be scalated, adding as many components as you may need and even adding a router if it was necessary.
I tried to optimize the performance by using the least amount of components to fulfill the purpose of the test.
