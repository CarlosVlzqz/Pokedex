This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Explain how you would improve the application and future plans.

I would create a Team feature were you would be able to create a pokemon team and it would provide some insight about your team; its weaknesses, strenghts, the most common pokemon type in your team and even some suggestions to strengthen your team, to perform this tasks I would use Redux similarly to the way I used it in this project.

## If you weren't able to finish all the goals of the project, how would you go out exucuting them?

I consider I complied with the tasks of the test.

## Explain your thoughts on the project you built, the Architecture of the folders, how you built the pages, and elements, etc.

I created my project separating the components which compose it from the actions they perform, additionally I used SASS to style my components, creating a separated folder for this porpuse.
This Architecture allows the project to be scalated, adding as many components as you may need and even adding a router if it was necessary.
I tried to optimize the performance by using the least amount of components to fulfill the purpose of the test.
